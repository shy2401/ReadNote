* Chapter 3. Syntax and Style
** Variable assignment
   1. y = (x = x + 1) #assignments not expressions, this returns invalid syntax error
   2. do not support ++x, x++, --x, x--
   3. multi assignment:
      - x = y = z = 1
      - x, y, z = 1, 2, 'a string'  ----> recommand (x, y, z) = (1, 2, "a string")
      - (x, y) = (y, x)   # swapping variables

** Special Underscore Identifiers
   1. __xxx do not import with 'from module import *'
   2. __xxx__ system-defined name
   3. __xxx request private name mangling in class

** Module Structure and Layout
   1. __name__ contains module name if imported
   2. __name__ contains '__main__' if executed directly
